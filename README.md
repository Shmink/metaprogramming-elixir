### Abstract

Reading this book to learn about how macros work and following some of the relevant
examples. This README will serve as my notes, therefore you shouldn't take them at face
value as the notes will make sense for me as I cherry pick a sentence or an analogy.
Moreover, don't expect direct quotes, changing the sentences vocbulary helps me personally.
